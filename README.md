# GoInsomniac

A simple terminal based program in Go to avoid my coorporate controlled laptop from going to sleep (sorry corp...).
Display some useful info along the way too.

Planning on expanding on it with further functionality and distribution / packaging mechanisms (Like Brew) soon.

Please standby...
